	<p>The holiday is celebrated in the United States from October 31 to November 2. Its tradition calls for the creation of altars to deceased loved ones, decorated with photos, meaningful objects and their favorite foods said to attract their souls. Tradition also calls for petals of bright yellow-orange marigold flowers to guide them from the cemetery.</p>
	<p>Even more awareness is anticipated this year, because it is the first Day of the Dead since Disney's November 2017 U.S. release of the animated film "Coco." The movie centered on the holiday and brought in more than $800 million worldwide.</p>
	<p>Last year, Netflix built altars for deceased characters from some of its shows. Disney faced backlash in 2013 for trying to trademark the term "Dia de los Muertos."</p>
